1. Get root priviledges.
2. lsblk // list all drive, find the drive with Windows installed
Often Windows don't completely shutdown but go into hibernate mode which makes the file read only
3. ntfsfix /dev/sdxy (x is for the name of the drive and y is for the partition number) // this fix the hibernation
4. ntfs-3g -O rw,remove_hiberfile /dev/sdxy  /(your directory path)  // This mount the drive( rw mena read and write,
remove_hiberfile remove the files that is kept in hibernate mode)
(To create a directory use mkdir)
5. If the drive is already mounted when boot then before step 3, use:
umount -l /dev/sdxy (-l to unmount the drive even when it is busy)
6. now cd to the SAM file directory (usually under Windows/System32/config)
7. chntpw -i SAM // just follow the instruction to blank the password of a user, do not blank default users 
(You might have to blank twice for it to work)
8. Now enter q into the prompt and q against to quit and write for the changes to take affect.

Now any local user will not ask you for password to login (except Microsoft Account users, but you can still reset Windows with it)
